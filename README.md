datagraph
=========

Datagraph is a minimalist data description language specifically designed for visualizing objects, their fields and their relations in a system.

The datagraph language gets transcompiled to the dot language of Graphviz.  Graphviz is able to generate a wide range of output formats such as PNG, PDF or PostScript.
